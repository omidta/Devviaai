      description: What is your hypothesis? What problem are you trying to solve?
      placeholder: |
        Hypothesis: If we provide AI-powered architecture recommendations during Stage 1, 
        then architects will produce higher-quality TBDs 30% faster.
        
        Assumption to test:
        - Architects spend significant time researching architecture patterns
        - AI can accurately suggest relevant Azure patterns
        - Time savings will justify the implementation cost
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea

    attributes:
      label: 🔨 Build - Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
      description: Describe the smallest version that can test your hypothesis
      placeholder: |
        MVP Scope:
        - Integration with OpenAI API for architecture suggestions
        - Support for 5 common architecture patterns
        - Simple command-line interface
        - Analysis of requirements to suggest patterns
        
        Out of Scope for MVP:
        - Visual diagram generation
        - Multi-cloud support
        - Web interface
        
        Implementation Plan:
        1. Create prompt template for architecture analysis
        2. Integrate OpenAI API client
        3. Parse requirements from input
        4. Generate recommendations
        5. Output structured suggestions

    attributes:
      label: 📊 Measure - Key Metrics
      description: What metrics will you track to validate the hypothesis?
      placeholder: |
        Primary Metrics:
        - Time to complete TBD: Baseline 8 hours → Target 5.6 hours (30% reduction)
        - TBD quality score: Baseline 7/10 → Target 8.5/10
        - Recommendation accuracy: Target > 80%
        
        Secondary Metrics:
        - User adoption rate: Target > 60% in first month
        - Number of recommendations used: Track acceptance rate
        - User satisfaction: Target NPS > 40
        
        Data Collection Method:
        - Built-in usage analytics
        - Before/after time tracking
        - User surveys
        - Quality assessment by peer review
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: learn
    attributes:
      label: 🧠 Learn - Success Criteria & Pivot Plan
      description: How will you determine if the hypothesis is validated? What's your pivot plan?
      placeholder: |
        Success Criteria:
        - ✅ Validated: If 2 of 3 primary metrics meet targets after 4 weeks
        - ❌ Invalidated: If < 1 primary metric meets targets
        - 🔄 Needs iteration: If mixed results
        
        Pivot Options if hypothesis fails:
        1. Persevere: Continue with minor adjustments
        2. Pivot - Customer Segment: Focus on junior architects instead
        3. Pivot - Problem: Address a different pain point in Stage 1
        4. Pivot - Solution: Try template-based recommendations instead of AI
        5. Abort: If fundamentally flawed, document learnings and move on
        
        Learning Plan:
        - Week 1-2: Release MVP to 5 beta users
        - Week 3: Collect feedback and metrics
        - Week 4: Analyze data and decide direction

    id: risks
    attributes:
      label: ⚠️ Risks & Assumptions
      description: What are the key risks and assumptions?
      placeholder: |
        Key Assumptions:
        1. Architects will trust AI recommendations
        2. OpenAI API will provide relevant suggestions
        3. Cost of API usage is acceptable
        
        Risks:
        - API reliability/availability
        - Recommendation quality issues
        - User resistance to AI tools
        - API costs exceed budget
        
        Mitigation Strategies:
        - Start with small user group
        - Set API rate limits and budgets
        - Provide transparency on AI limitations
        - Include human review process
